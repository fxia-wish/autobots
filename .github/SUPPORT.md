# Support

If you are looking for support, here are a few options:

- [Slack](https://logicians.slack.com/archives/CRUAK4VSA)
- [Documentation](https://github.com/ContextLogic/autobots/blob/master/README.md)

You can also open a support ticket in [Jira](https://jira.wish.site/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa) with project **Infra Tools & Automation (ITA)**. 

Last, but not least you can send us an email at <infra-automation@contextlogic.com>.
