## Introduction

Thank you so much for your interest in contributing!. All types of contributions are encouraged and valued. See the [table of contents](#toc) for different ways to help and details about how this project handles them!üìù

Please make sure to read the relevant section before making your contribution! It will make it a lot easier for us maintainers to make the most of it and smooth out the experience for all involved. üíö

The [Project Team](#join-the-project-team) looks forward to your contributions. üôåüèæ‚ú®

## Request Support

If you have a question about this project, how to use it, or just need clarification about something:

* Join the [#micro-svc-fmk](https://logicians.slack.com/archives/CRUAK4VSA) channel
  * Even though Slack is a chat service, sometimes it takes several hours for community members to respond ‚Äî please be patient!
* Sign up the [Tools & Automation Office Hours](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UUcxS2s4SGZGSG0zfGRlZmF1bHR8MzExZTc3OTNkYWRlNDgyNWI0YzhiNGJkNDUyZjVjOWE)


## Report an Error or Bug

If you run into an error or bug with the project:

* Open an Issue in the [Jira](https://jira.wish.site/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa) with project **Infra Tools & Automation (ITA)**.
* Include *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the bug or error on their own.
* Provide what seems relevant. If not, please be ready to provide that information if maintainers ask for it.

## Request a Feature

If the project doesn't do something you need or want it to do:

* Open an Issue in the [Jira](https://jira.wish.site/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa) with project **Infra Tools & Automation (ITA)**.
* Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
* Please try and be clear about why existing features and alternatives would not work for you.

Note: The team is unlikely to be able to accept every single feature request that is filed. Please understand if they need to say no.

## Project Setup

So you wanna contribute some code! That's great! This project uses GitHub Pull Requests to manage contributions, so [read up on how to use [Github Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) if you've never done it before.

Please follow the [documentation](https://github.com/ContextLogic/autobots#how-to-use) to finish the project setup

## Contribute Documentation

Documentation is a super important, critical part of this project. Docs are how we keep track of what we're doing, how, and why. It's how we stay on the same page about our policies. And it's how we tell others everything they need in order to be able to use this project -- or contribute to it. So thank you in advance.

Documentation contributions of any size are welcome! Feel free to file a PR even if you're just rewording a sentence to be more clear, or fixing a spelling mistake!

To contribute documentation:

* [Set up the project](#project-setup).
* Edit or add any relevant documentation.
* Make sure your changes are formatted correctly and consistently with the rest of the documentation.
* Re-read what you wrote, and run a spellchecker on it to make sure you didn't miss anything.
* Write clear, concise commit message(s) using [conventional-changelog format](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog-angular/blob/master/convention.md). Documentation commits should use `docs(<component>): <message>`.
* Go to https://github.com/ContextLogic/autobots/pulls and open a new pull request with your changes and request [automation-team](https://github.com/orgs/ContextLogic/teams/automation-team) as reviewer 

## Contribute Code

We like code commits a lot! They're super handy, and they keep the project going and doing the work it needs to do to be useful to others.

Code contributions of just about any size are acceptable!

The main difference between code contributions and documentation contributions is that contributing code requires inclusion of relevant tests for the code being added or changed. Contributions without accompanying tests will be held off until a test is added, unless the maintainers consider the specific tests to be either impossible, or way too much of a burden for such a contribution.

To contribute code:

* [Set up the project](#project-setup).
* Make any necessary changes to the source code.
* Include any [additional documentation](#contribute-documentation) the changes might need.
* Write tests that verify that your contribution works as expected.
* Write clear, concise commit message(s) using [conventional-changelog format](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog-angular/blob/master/convention.md).
* Dependency updates, additions, or removals must be in individual commits
* Go to https://github.com/ContextLogic/autobots/pulls and open a new pull request with your changes and request [automation-team](https://github.com/orgs/ContextLogic/teams/automation-team) as reviewer
